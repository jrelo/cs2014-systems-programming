CS2014 Lab 3 : Reverse Polisn Notation Calculator

Thursday 15th October

The goal of this project is to develop a simple calculator for
expressions in reverse Polish notation. Your program should read in a
line of text containing an expression in postfix (or reverse Polish
notation) and write out the value of that expression.

For example, an interaction with your program might look something like:
    mycalc> Please enter a postfix expression
    mycalc> 7 8 3 X 28 + +
    mycalc> 59
    
The operators that you calculator should support are plus (+),
minus (-), multiply (X) and divide (/), and they should operate
on double precision floating point numbers.

The algorithm for computing the value of an expression in reverse
Polish notation is simple:

for each token in the input string {
  if ( token is a number ) {
    push token onto the stack
  }
  else if ( token is an operator ) {
    pop the top two items off the stack
    apply the operator to the two items
    push the result onto the stack
  }
}

At the end of this computation, if you are dealing with a correctly-
formed expression, there should be exactly one number on the stack.
This is the result of the expression.

Note that you can assume that the expression that your program
receives is well formed. You do not have to do any complicated error
checking.

When writing your program, your code will be more beautiful if you
write a stack abstract data type (ADT) for evaluating the
expressions. Ideally your ADT will provide functions to implement at
least the following operation: push, pop, isempty.

This lab will be marked, and will count towards your end of year mark.
You should submit your work through Blackboard by 11.59PM on
Wednesday 21st October. To be marked, you must demonstrate and answer
questions on your project at your regular lab session on Thursday 22nd
October. You must demonstrate the same code that you submit. All work
should be your own.
